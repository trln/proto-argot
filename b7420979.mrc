Researchers at established institutions in Europe and America share their observations, as well.  The documentary opens with the dramatic story of a 26-year-old man who attempted suicide by swallowing a huge dose of pills he had been given. Nothing the ER crew tried to help revive him was any benefit. Ultimately ER contacted his family doctor who revealed that the pills were a placebo for a double-blind study. Learning that, the patient made a full recovery, his vital signs improved, and he was cured.  Forty-year-old Judy was violently dyskinetic; she could be violently flailing around one moment, and unable to move the next. Thinking she had undergone brain surgery to correct her condition, her symptoms disappeared.  Dr. Fabrizzio Benedetti in Turin tells of remarkable success treating Parkinson's patients using placebos. A specialist in developmental cell biology asserts that only 10% of physical illness is "physical." When we are afraid, he says, stress hormones are released. The film asserts that alternative methods such as meditation and visualization should be used more often to treat patients. The brain and the immune system clearly communicate with one another.  aThis edition in English.  aProvider: Alexander Street Press.  aVendor-supplied catalog record.  aPreviously released as DVD. 0aHealth. 0aMental health. 0aMental illness. 0aMind and body. 7aNonfiction films.2lcgft.2 aDanmarks radio.0 tFilmakers library online (online collection)1 cOriginalw(OCoLC)808842266.40yStreaming video available via the UNC-Chapel Hill Librariesuhttp://libproxy.lib.unc.edu/login?url=http://www.aspresolver.com/aspresolver.asp?FLON;1760822xFilmakers library online  a.b74209796b10-19-15c06-20-13  aeraesaulb06-20-13cmdgfenggnyuh0i0  a.b7420979a  9Baseline 9_20139Under Authority Control  aASPSVFLON  afilmfinder  aBatch load history: 109 Filmmakers Library records loaded 20130620, kms.  g1j0lestr nPerpetual accessonp$0.00q-r-s-t76u0v0w0x0y.i100287359z06-20-13
